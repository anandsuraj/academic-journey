        "The Synsets Demonstration effectively showcases the power and structure of WordNet as a lexical database for natural language processing. By examining words like 'good', 'service', 'quality', and 'bank', we observe that each term exhibits polysemy, with multiple synsets representing distinct senses across parts of speech (e.g., nouns and adjectives). For instance, 'good' spans concepts from moral excellence to commercial commodities, while 'bank' differentiates between financial institutions and geographical features. This highlights WordNet's ability to capture nuanced semantic relationships, including definitions, examples, and POS tags, which are foundational for tasks such as word sense disambiguation, sentiment analysis, and semantic similarity computation. Overall, the demonstration underscores how WordNet enables more accurate and context aware NLP applications by providing a rich, hierarchical framework for understanding word meanings beyond surface level interpretations."

        "The results clearly show how WordNet organizes words into a hierarchy, where hypernyms represent broader categories and hyponyms represent more specific subtypes.\n",
        "\n",
        "- For “animal”, the hypernym is organism, meaning all animals fall under the broader category of living beings. The hyponyms include examples like herbivore, invertebrate, and domestic animal, which are narrower, more specialized types of animals. This shows how WordNet breaks down a large category into smaller, meaningful groups.\n",
        "\n",
        "- For “vehicle”, the hypernym is conveyance, since a vehicle is essentially something that helps in transportation. The hyponyms list covers specific vehicles such as sled, military vehicle, and rocket. This demonstrates how the category “vehicle” branches into different modes of transport.\n",
        "\n",
        "- For “food”, the hypernym is substance, because food is considered a type of material. Its hyponyms include beverage, feed, yolk, and nutriment, which highlight the variety of things we classify as food.\n",
        "\n",
        "- For “furniture”, the hypernym is furnishing, since furniture is part of what makes a space livable. The hyponyms, such as office furniture, baby bed, and chest of drawers, reflect the specific pieces of furniture used in different contexts.\n",
        "\n",
        "- For “emotion”, the hypernym is feeling, as emotions are one form of human feeling. The hyponyms include anger, joy, love, and anxiety, showing the diversity of emotional experiences under the general category of “emotion.”\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, these outputs justify that WordNet’s hypernym-hyponym structure is effective for representing the general-to-specific relationship in language. It helps machines understand that words are not isolated but part of a larger hierarchy of meaning."

        "- Most of the scores come out very low, even for words that we naturally see as related. For example, car and vehicle or good and excellent clearly have a strong connection in everyday use, but WordNet only gives them a low score because they sit further apart in its hierarchy.\n",
        "- Pairs like happy–sad or love–hate also get a small similarity value—not because they’re alike, but because they’re both classified under the same broad category of emotions.\n",
        "- Interestingly, even close pairs like dog–cat or computer–laptop score very low, showing the limitation of this method.\n",
        "- In short, WordNet’s path similarity only looks at how close words are in its taxonomy, not how people actually relate them in real life."

        "In the sentence “I went to the bank to deposit money”, the word bank is correctly understood as a financial institution because of clues like deposit and money.\n",
        "\n",
        "For “The river bank was covered with flowers”, the intended meaning is land beside a river, but the system wrongly picks the financial sense. This happens because the algorithm only looks for word overlaps, not deeper context.\n",
        "\n",
        "In “The bat flew out of the cave”, the correct meaning should be the animal, but the system selects the sports equipment sense. Again, this shows a weakness of the method.\n",
        "\n",
        "For “He hit the ball with a wooden bat”, the choice of the sports related sense is accurate since the words hit and ball clearly point to it.\n",
        "\n",
        "In “She plays the piano beautifully”, the algorithm picks a related but slightly incorrect sense. The best match would be playing an instrument, but overlap based matching led to a less precise choice.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, “The children play in the garden” is correctly disambiguated as children engaging in recreational activity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, the results show that the method works well when strong clues are present, but it struggles when words have multiple common senses or when the context is less direct."
